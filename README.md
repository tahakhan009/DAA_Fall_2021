# Minimum N-Queens Problem Simulator
I simulated minimum n-queens problem with two algorithms : **Divide & Conq** and **Dynamic Programming** using javascript language

This project helps you to see the process of solving n-queens problem using the two mentioned algorithms and compare the performance.

# JS Files Explanation
1. **js/DP-tools.js** : A light-weight tool box for DP algorithm contains several methods.
2. **js/chess-ui.js** : A Chess UI generator which takes an object of Engine class and visualize that engines steps.
3. **js/n-queens-DivideAndCoq-engine.js** : Divide And Conq engine to solve minimum n-queens problem.
4. **js/n-queens-DP-engine.js** : DP Algorithm based engine to solve Minimum n-queens problem.
